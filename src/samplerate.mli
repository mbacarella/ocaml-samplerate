(** Kind of converter. *)
type converter =
  | Conv_sinc_best_quality (** This is a bandlimited interpolator derived from the mathematical sinc function and this is the highest quality sinc based converter, providing a worst case Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 97 decibels (dB) at a bandwidth of 97%. All three Conv_sinc_* converters are based on the techniques of Julius O. Smith  although this code was developed independantly. *)
  | Conv_sinc_medium_quality (** This is another bandlimited interpolator much like the previous one. It has an SNR of 97dB and a bandwidth of 90%. The speed of the conversion is much faster than the previous one. *)
  | Conv_fastest (** This is the fastest bandlimited interpolator and has an SNR of 97dB and a bandwidth of 80%. *)
  | Conv_zero_order_hold (** A Zero Order Hold converter (interpolated value is equal to the last value). The quality is poor but the conversion speed is blindlingly fast. *)
  | Conv_linear (** A linear converter. Again the quality is poor, but the conversion speed is blindingly fast. *)
